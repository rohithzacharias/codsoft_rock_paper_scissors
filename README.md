# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a classic **Rock Paper Scissors game** built using **Python's `tkinter` library** for the graphical user interface (GUI) and **`pygame` for sound effects**. This project was developed as my **4th Internship Project**, focusing on GUI development and interactive gameplay.
